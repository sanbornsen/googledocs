Google Docs Scripts

Here I'm gonna explain some simple ways to customize google docs (drive now) spreadsheet, and forms with java script to send emails from the spread sheet, make registration etc. This is usefull sometime.

1. onFormSubmit()
     In this script we update a particular cell with every submission of the form. Autoupdating ID is an example mentioned here.

2. formSubmitReply()
     This script is usefull to reply automatically who ever fill the form to his email id given to the form. What it does exactly take the email ID from the form and send what ever detalis you want to send by an email whenever he submits the form.

I have a blog(http://icode4food.blogspot.in/2012/12/google-drive-form.html), everything is clearly mentioned there, if anyone wants to modify these codes and come up with easier things please share, also add more apps that you have worked on google docs.
